# Day 10 – JavaScript Basics  

Today I started with the **fundamentals of JavaScript** and practiced how JS interacts with HTML.  
I learned how to use `document.getElementById` to manipulate HTML elements dynamically.  

# ✅ Topics Covered
1. JavaScript can change HTML content (using `innerHTML`).  
2. JavaScript can change HTML styles (like font size).  
3. JavaScript can hide HTML content (`display = none`).  
4. JavaScript can show hidden HTML content (`display = block`).  
5. Difference between using **single quotes** and **double quotes** in onclick attributes.
6. Writing JavaScript inside the `<head>` tag.  
   - Functions defined in head must run after DOM loads (e.g., on button click).  
7. Writing JavaScript inside the `<body>` tag.  
   - Functions inside body can run immediately since elements already exist.  
8. Best practice: placing JavaScript at the **end of body** for performance. 

# 💻 Practice Work
- Wrote code examples where clicking a button changes text, style, hides, or shows content.  
- Practiced using both single and double quotes in JavaScript code inside HTML.
- Created a function inside `<head>` that changes text when a button is clicked.  
- Created another function inside `<body>` that increases font size of text when a button is clicked.  

# 🚀 Summary
Learned the **basic DOM manipulations** with JavaScript:
- Changing text content.  
- Styling elements.  
- Hiding and showing HTML dynamically.
Understood the **importance of script placement**:
- `<head>` scripts → must wait for elements.  
- `<body>` scripts → safer, can directly access elements.  
- Real projects → usually place scripts at the end of body or use external `.js` files.

# Day 11 – JavaScript Basics (Display + Arithmetic Operators)
Today I practiced different ways to display output in JavaScript and implemented arithmetic operators using functions.

# ✅ Topics Covered
1. JavaScript Display Methods
     -> innerHTML → Change HTML content dynamically.
     -> innerText → Display plain text inside HTML elements.
     -> document.write() → Write directly to the page (but removes existing content if used after load).
     -> window.alert() → Display content in an alert popup.
     -> console.log() → Log output to the browser console.
     -> window.print() → Print the current page.

2. JavaScript Statements
     -> Simple statements like a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;
     -> Grouping statements inside functions and executing them via button click.
     -> Undefined variables (let myName;) → results in undefined.

3. Arithmetic Operators
   -> Implemented functions to perform operations on two input numbers:
       Addition → +
       Subtraction → -
       Multiplication → *
       Division → /
       Modulus (Remainder) → %
   Each operator result is displayed dynamically inside a <p> tag.

# 📝 Practice Work
    -> Built interactive HTML pages with buttons to trigger JS functions.
    -> Connected external JavaScript file (arithmaticOperators.js) to keep code organized.
    -> Practiced taking input values, converting them using Number(), and returning results.

# 🚀 Summary
     -> Today I worked on JavaScript output methods and basic arithmetic operations.
     -> I now understand how to:
           * Show results on the page, in alerts, or in the console.
           * Perform calculations with input values using functions.
           * Keep JS code structured by using external .js files.

Tomorrow, I will continue with JavaScript Data Types and Operators in detail.

# Day 12 – JavaScript Basics
Today I practiced **JavaScript Increment/Decrement** and **HTML Events** with external JS functions.  

✅ What I Learned
How to use HTML events to make a webpage interactive.
Linking external JavaScript file (events.js) with HTML.
Handling mouse, keyboard, form, and window events.
Using DOM methods like getElementById() to dynamically update content.

📝 Events Implemented
🔘 Mouse Events
onclick → Show current date & time.
ondblclick → Show my name on double-click.
onmouseover & onmouseout → Trigger alert or change text when hovering in/out.

⌨️ Keyboard Events
onkeydown & onkeyup → Display which key was pressed/released using event.key.

📌 Form & Input Events
onchange → Detect selected option from dropdown.
onfocus & onblur → Highlight input field when active/inactive.
oninput → Show live typed text instantly.
onsubmit → Show alert on form submission and prevent page reload with return false;.

🌍 Window Events
window.onload → Executes when the page finishes loading.
window.onresize → Logs a message whenever browser window is resized.

🚀 Key Takeaways
Events connect user actions to JavaScript logic.
Inline event attributes (onclick="...") can be separated into external JS for cleaner code.
event.key captures the exact key pressed.
return false; in onsubmit stops default form submission behavior (page reload).
Window events allow responding to page load and resize actions.
